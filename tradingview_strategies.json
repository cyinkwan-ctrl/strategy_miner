    "description": "On the H1 chart, Gold is clearly trading inside a defined sideway range, with price now hovering near the upper boundary (Resistance Zone ~5,080 area).\n📊 Market Structure\n- After the sharp recovery from the previous sell-off, price transitioned into range equilibrium.\n- The EMA cluster (short & mid-term) is flattening and slightly rising → indicating balance, not expansion.\n- Higher lows inside the range show mild internal bullish pressure.\n- However, price is still capped below clear resistance",

    "description": "This idea presents a historical market structure study based on WD Gann’s price–time principles, focusing on how downside pressure often pauses near exhaustion zones.\n\n ⚠️ This post is not a trading signal and is shared strictly for educational purposes. \n\n 📌 Context of the Study \n \n By late September 2022, NIFTY was still under downside pressure.\n However, price–time symmetry and vibration balance suggested that the decline was approaching a temporary pause zone, rather than an immediate trend ",
